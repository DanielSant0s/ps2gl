<h3>
Introduction</h3>
ps2gl is an OpenGL*-like API for the ps2. It is intended to be useful for
anyone looking for a familiar API on the ps2, but its main purposes in
life are to provide an easier way to write games and to serve as an example
of a ps2 rendering layer. In a perfect world ps2gl would be just another
OpenGL* implementation, but unfortunately that is not to be. The reason,
aside from licensing issues, is that many parts of the OpenGL* API are
not well suited to the PlayStation 2 architecture and would require software
emulation, which is undesirable.&nbsp;
<p>Still, all hope is not lost; many of the calls act the same as their
OpenGL* counterparts, while the rest behave similarly.&nbsp;
<p>Finally, ps2gl is still quite young, and developers who decide to use
it can expect to find bugs, inconsistencies, and incomplete features. Since
ps2gl is also an open source project, its users are<b> welcome to participate
in its development</b>. One of ps2gl's main design requirements is that
it be easy to understand and modify. CVS (version control) write access
is available to frequent contributors, and read access to the working cvs
tree is always available.&nbsp;<a NAME="latest"></a>
<h3>
Latest Version</h3>
The latest version can always be found on the homepage: <a href="https://www.ps2-pro.com/projects/ps2gl/">https://www.ps2-pro.com/projects/ps2gl/</a>
<br>for game development and now <a href="http://ps2gl.playstation2-linux.com">http://ps2gl.playstation2-linux.com</a>
for the linux version.
<br>The homepage also hosts bug tracking, news, cvs versions, and discussion
groups.&nbsp;<a NAME="contents"></a>

<h3>
Installing</h3>
ps2gl depends on another package called ps2stuff. You'll find it at <a href="https://www.ps2-pro.com/projects/ps2gl/">https://www.ps2-pro.com/projects/ps2gl/</a>
or <a href="http://ps2gl.playstation2-linux.com">http://ps2gl.playstation2-linux.com.</a>&nbsp;
ps2stuff is a collection of utilities for dealing with the ps2 hardware
and forms the layer on top of which ps2gl is built.&nbsp;
<p>To use ps2gl you'll want to link against the libps2stuff.a and libps2gl.a
libraries.&nbsp; There is also a very poor imitation of glut used mainly
for testing, but useful to get something running quickly.&nbsp; The libraries
are found in the directories obj_buildname, where buildname is the name
of the build you want to use.
<p>Here are the most useful game development builds:
<ul>
<li>
<b>debug</b> - No optimization, contains debug information and error checking.
This build is useful for stepping through in a debugger.</li>

<li>
<b>optimized</b> - Optimized, but contains debug info and error checking.
Mainly for day-to-day coding.</li>

<li>
<b>release</b> - Optimized, no debug info or error checking. For, well...
release.</li>
</ul>
The linux binary packages only contain the 'linux' build, which is similar
to the 'optimized' build described above.
<p>You'll find ps2gl in ps2gl/objs_* and ps2glut in ps2gl/glut/objs_*.&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="example"></a>
<h3>
Building the examples</h3>
<b>linux/gcc</b>
<p>After expanding the ps2gl and ps2stuff archives into the same directory,
chdir to ps2gl/example/box.&nbsp; Now 'make run' should do it.
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; there is a known bug where make sometimes tries to run the
'vcl' program.&nbsp; If this happens, cd to ps2gl/vu1 and do a 'touch *_vcl.vsm.'

</ul>
The api documentation for ps2gl is generated from source comments using
a wonderful program called <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">doxygen</a>.
The full documentation for both the external api (gl* and pgl*) and the
internal implementation is included:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<a href="doxygen_generated/modules.html">public API (gl* and pgl*)</a></li>

<li>
<a href="doxygen_generated/index.html">full documentation</a></li>
</ul>
You'll notice that internal documentation is quite scarce at the moment...
It will gradually get better.&nbsp;<a NAME="bugs"></a>
<h3>
Bugs</h3>
Bug reports should be submitted to the appropriate homepage, which hosts
a bug tracking system. (Be sure to check the bug tracker to see if the
problem has already been reported and/or resolved.)&nbsp;
